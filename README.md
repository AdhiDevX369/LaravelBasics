   - Select **Environment Variables** and then **Path** under System Variables.
   - Add the path to your PHP folder (e.g., `C:\php`).

3. Verify the installation by running `php -v` in the Command Prompt. You should see the PHP version if itâ€™s installed correctly.

### 2. Install Composer

1. Download the latest Composer setup file from [Composer Download](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
